Tkinter library, that included in most Python distributions.


Install
-------

This module was packaged and distributed in the standard way,
i.e. using the Python Distutils. So it can installed how
described in Python documentation here:
http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#standard-build-and-install

You need to do some commands like this:

  tar xzf scato-VER.tgz
  cd scato-VER
  python setup.py build
  sudo -s
  python setup.py install


Run without installation
------------------------

You can run Scato without installation. Just unpack it, change
current directory to the distribution, and do something like this
(sh/bash):

  PYTHONPATH=`pwd` python script/scato
